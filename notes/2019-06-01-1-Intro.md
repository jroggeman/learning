# Intro
## General Information
- Purely functional language
  - Imperative languages
    - Provide a sequence of tasks for computer to execute
    - C, C#, Java, etc
  - Declarative (?) languages
    - Provide a set of definitions and what you want figured out
    - Computer handles the operation
    - SQL, Haskell
  - Haskell properties
    - All operations represented as **functions**
    - Variables are _immutable_
    - Functions have _no side effects_ - cannot mutate non-local state
    - Functions are idempotent
    - Haskell is (by default) _lazily evaluated_
    - Haskell is _statically typed_ with _type inference_

## Getting Started
- Provided functionality
  - `ghc` is the Haskell compiler
  - `ghci` is the interactive Haskell REPL
  - Aside - `ghc` stands for _Glasgow Haskell Compiler_. Just happens to be most popular.
- Basic math
  - Haskell will compute math like a calculator
  - Follows standard order of operations
- Boolean algebra
  - `True` and `False`
  - Binary operators are `||` and `&&`
  - "Not" is just `not`
- Comparisons
  - `==` and `/=` are standard. Note the unusual "not equals notation" - similar to formal math
  - `>`, `<`, etc. work as expected
  - Types must be _compatible_ - more on that later

## Functions
- All the basic operations are functions
  - Mathematical operations and comparison are functions
  - Operator between the operands: **infix function**
  - Most are **prefix functions**, where operator comes first
- Function application has highest precedence (it binds tightest and is evaluated first)
  - `succ 9 * 10` is evaluated by default as `(succ 9) * 10` which is `100`
  - Must include parentheses to get the successor of 90: `succ (9 * 10) == 91`
  - **Parenthese are only for order of operations - not function application**

## Simple Math Functions
- See [simple-math.hs](../code/simple-math.hs)
- Introduced a very simple doubling function: `doubleMe x = x + x`
  - We also introduced a two-argument version
  - We can rewrite the two-argument version to use the first function
- Function reuse and composition is highly recommended
  - Easier to validate smaller functions
  - Easier to make systemwide changes (more localized)
- Introduced `if` statement
  - _All statements in Haskell must return a value_
  - They're really expressions in that respect
  - Ergo, an `if` statement **must** have an `else` block associated.
  - Ergo, in the interactive terminal, something as simple as `4` is an expression
  - Ergo, everything is a statement! Whoa!
- Some other neat things to note
  - Single quotes appended to a function name usually means a strict (non-lazy) or slightly modified version
  - Function names and variable names can _not_ be capitalized
  - A function with no arguments is just a definition (remember, it can not have side effects)

## Lists
- Lists are homogenous
- Similar to arrays in other languages: `[1, 3, 2, 5]`
- Strings are just arrays of characters - not just internally, but natively
- Concatenation done with infix operator `++`
- Insert an element at the start of a list with the infix operator `:` (also called the _cons operator_; probably more relevant later)
- These are stored internally as singly-linked lists
  - Concatenating arrays is `O(n)`
  - Inserting at the head is `O(1)`
- Aside - `[1, 2, 3]` is syntactic sugar for `1:2:3:[]`
- Access list elements iwth the infix `!!` operator followed by the index (starting at zero)
- Lists can be nested
- The empty list is itself an element
- Common list operations
  - `head` - the first element
  - `tail` - all remaining after `head`
  - `last` - the final element
  - `init` - all remaining after `last`
  - `length` - Number of elements in list
  - `null` - is list empty
  - `reverse` - elements in reverse order
  - `take` - given a number and a list, takes first _number_ elements from the list
  - `drop` - like take, but instead _removes_ those elements from the beginning of the list
  - `maximum` and `minimum` - Returns the max or min value from the list, if the elements of the list can be ordered.
  - `sum` and `product` - Takes the sum and product of all elements of the list if they are numeric
  - `elem` - takes an item and a list, returns true if the item is an element of said list.
